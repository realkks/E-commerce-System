    // and interact with a fake store for testing purposes.
    // For example, it could return hardcoded product data or simulate
    // interactions with a fake database.

    // Example method (to be implemented):
    // public List<ProductResponseDto> getAllProducts() {
    //     // Return a list of products from the fake store
    // }

    // Additional methods would be defined here as per the ProductService interface
